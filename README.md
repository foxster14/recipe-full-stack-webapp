# Recipe Arsenal: A Full-Stack Web Application
This is a small, full-stack web application that displays visualized data resourced from a RESTFul API. 

## Back-End Features
* CRUD(Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) Operations utilizing a JSON file as the persistent data store that contains registered and existing users. The CRUD operations will only be performed on registered and existing users.
* Authentication and Authorization using passport.js. Incorporate the passport third-party module and use the localhost strategy that will allow end- users to perform the functions identified in the first feature
* Establish a RESTFul API connection from a reliable source. Select a reliable data source that provides multiple records/tuples to visually depict in chart.
* Unit tests that check critical back-end functions

## Front-End Features
* Implement a charting library that provides visualization of data that is being resourced from the API
* End-user manipulation of visualized data. The end-user is able to use an input element such as a drop-down menu or radio button to change the view of data being presented.
* Site is responsive and implements a color, graphic, typography and layout strategy
* Site uses an HTML based framework called Handlebars.js
